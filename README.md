# Problem Solving in C++ - Level 4

Welcome to my C++ problem-solving repository! In this repository, I solve various algorithmic problems to enhance my programming skills in C++. Each problem is stored in its own directory, and this README will describe each of the exercises.

## Exercise 1: Convert Number To Word Representation

### Problem Statement:

The task is to converts a given integer (0 to 999,999,999,999) into its English word representation. The program should handle large numbers with proper formatting, including "thousand", "million" and "billion"

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 2: Leap Year Verification

### Problem Statement:

The task is to verify whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is defined as a year that satisfies one of the following two conditions:

=> The year is divisible by 400, or

=> The year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 3: Leap Year Verification Code Optimization

### Problem Statement:

The task is to optimize the code from the previous exercise into a single line of code.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 4: Convert Year To Time

### Problem Statement:

The task is to output the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds in a given year based on whether it is a leap year or not.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 5: Convert Month To Time

### Problem Statement:

The task is to output the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds for a given month in a specific year. If the month is 2 (February), it should check whether the year is a leap year to determine if February has 28 or 29 days. For all other months, it should return the correct number of days based on the month (e.g., 31 days for January, March, May, etc., and 30 days for April, June, September, November). Then, calculate the corresponding number of hours, minutes, and seconds for the given month.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 6: Convert Month To Time Code Optimization

### Problem Statement:

The task is to optimize the code from the previous exercise into a single line of code.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 7: Day of the Week Calculator

### Problem Statement:

calculates the day of the week for a given date (day, month, year). It takes user input for the date and then displays the corresponding day name (e.g., "Mon").

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 8: Print Month Calendar

### Problem Statement:

The task is to print the calendar of a given month and year.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 9: Print Year Calendar

### Problem Statement:

The task is to print the calendar of a given year.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 10 : Days Of Beginning Of Year

The task is to print the number of days that have passed in the year, given a specific month, day, and year.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:
