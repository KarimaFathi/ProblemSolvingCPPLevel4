# Problem Solving in C++ - Level 4

Welcome to my C++ problem-solving repository! In this repository, I solve various algorithmic problems to enhance my programming skills in C++. Each problem is stored in its own directory, and this README will describe each of the exercises.

## Exercise 1: Convert Number To Word Representation

### Problem Statement:

The task is to converts a given integer (0 to 999,999,999,999) into its English word representation. The program should handle large numbers with proper formatting, including "thousand", "million" and "billion"

### Output:

Below is an example of the output of the multiplication table generated by the program:
