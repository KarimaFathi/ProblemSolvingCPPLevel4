# Problem Solving in C++ - Level 4

Welcome to my C++ problem-solving repository! In this repository, I solve various algorithmic problems to enhance my programming skills in C++. Each problem is stored in its own directory, and this README will describe each of the exercises.

## Exercise 1: Convert Number To Word Representation

### Problem Statement:

The task is to converts a given integer (0 to 999,999,999,999) into its English word representation. The program should handle large numbers with proper formatting, including "thousand", "million" and "billion"

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 2: Leap Year Verification

### Problem Statement:

The task is to verify whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is defined as a year that satisfies one of the following two conditions:

=> The year is divisible by 400, or

=> The year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 3: Leap Year Verification Code Optimization

### Problem Statement:

The task is to optimize the code from the previous exercise into a single line of code.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:

## Exercise 4: Convert Year To Time

### Problem Statement:

The task is to output the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds in a given year based on whether it is a leap year or not.

### Output:

Below is an example of the program's output:
